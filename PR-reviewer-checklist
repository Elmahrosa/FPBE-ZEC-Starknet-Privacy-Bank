Title: feat(zk): implement zec_light_client with verifier integration and tests

This PR replaces placeholder stubs with a working zec_light_client module that:
- Verifies serialized ZEC header updates via an on‑chain verifier (or badge‑gated relayer logic).
- Updates `verified_head` storage and emits `HeaderVerified` events.
- Includes unit tests (cairo-test) and deterministic test vectors (specs/test_vectors).
- Adds CI job to build/verifier smoke tests and uploads proof artifacts.

Files added/changed:
- cairo_modules/zec_light_client.cairo (implementation + view functions)
- specs/zec_light_client.md (spec + threat model)
- specs/test_vectors/*.bin (deterministic serialized headers)
- tests/zec_light_client_test.cairo (unit tests)
- .github/workflows/cairo-ci.yml (updated: add verifier-integration job)

Reviewer checklist
- [ ] Spec present and linked in code (specs/zec_light_client.md).
- [ ] Unit tests pass locally and in CI.
- [ ] Verifier accepts good proofs and rejects tampered proofs (see artifacts).
- [ ] Proof artifacts uploaded to CI for auditor download.
- [ ] At least two independent reviewers approve.
- [ ] Governance signoff issue referenced if production activation is requested.

Notes
- This PR requires circuit/verifier artifacts produced by the circuits CI job. See `.github/workflows` for details.
